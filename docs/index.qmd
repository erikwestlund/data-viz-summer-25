This course was offered as a 1-credit introduction (5.5 instruction hours) to data visualization as part of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's [43rd Graduate Summer Institute of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/academics/graduate-summer-institute-of-epidemiology-and-biostatistics).

Materials used in the course are listed below.

  # Handle applications_{n}_ prefix
  if (grepl("^applications_\\d+_", text)) {
    text <- sub("^applications_\\d+_", "Applications: ", text)

    "llm" = "LLM",
    "ggplot" = "ggplot",
    "Prams" = "PRAMS",
    "prams" = "PRAMS",  
    "dag" = "DAG"

  # Split by underscores

      return(special_cases[[tolower(word)]])
    }
    # Otherwise capitalize
    return(tools::toTitleCase(word))
  })
  
  # Join with spaces
  str <- paste(words, collapse = " ")
  
  # Replace any dangling instances of "Ggplot" with "ggplot"
  str <- gsub("Ggplot", "ggplot", str)
  
  return(str)
}

# Function to get all HTML files in a directory
get_html_files <- function(dir, link_dir) {
  files <- list.files(dir, pattern = "\\.html$", full.names = TRUE)
  # Sort by filename
  files <- sort(files)
  # Get just the filenames without path and extension
  names <- sub("\\.html$", "", basename(files))
  # Format the link text
  display_names <- sapply(names, format_link_text)
  # Create links with the correct directory
  links <- sprintf("- [%s](%s)", display_names, file.path(link_dir, basename(files)))

}

# Get and display lecture links
knitr::asis_output(get_html_files("slides", "slides"))
```

## Examples

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Get and display example links
knitr::asis_output(get_html_files("examples", "examples"))
```

## Postmortems

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Get and display postmortem links
knitr::asis_output(get_html_files("postmortems", "postmortems"))
```

## Credits

* All files on this page were created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Students were likewise encouraged to use Quarto to create their own visualizations.
* A major debt is owed to Kieran Healy for his [Data Visualization book](https://socviz.co/).
* Many of the materials here were first developed for the [Johns Hopkins Maternal Health Data Innovation and Coordinating Hub](https://maternalhealthhub.jhu.edu/johns-hopkins-university#:~:text=The%20Hub%20is%20a%20multidisciplinary,Medicine%20at%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University) of the [NIH Maternal Health Research Centers of Excellence](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-establishes-maternal-health-research-centers-excellence).
* LLMs were used to aid in creation of many of the visuals in this course. Any mistakes made by LLMs are ultimately my own.
