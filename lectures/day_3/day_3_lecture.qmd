# Day 3: What to Visualize â€“ From Question to Plot

## Overview for Day 3

::: {.incremental}
- Scientific questions and DAGs
- What to visualize: distributions, time, space, relationships, models
- Key design principles: honesty, annotation, small multiples
- Case studies: 7 applied examples
:::


## Theme: Science Drives Visualization

* Data visualization is valuable for its scientific application
* It helps us:
    - Understand our data
    - Understand our models
    - Communicate our findings in an impactful way

# DAGs, Scientific Complexity, Causal Inference, and Visualization

## From Question to DAG to Plot

* We'll start with a scientific question.
* We'll sketch out the causal structure using a DAG.
* From this, we can assess typical problems scientific studies like this face
* We can then use the DAG to guide our visualization choices

## Scientific Question

"What causes mothers to receive comprehensive postnatal care?"

## Directed Acyclic Graphs

* A DAG is a graph that represents the causal relationships between variables.
* It is a directed graph, meaning that the edges have a direction.
* It is an acyclic graph, meaning that there are no cycles in the graph.
* It is a graph, meaning that it has nodes and edges.

## How DAGs Help Us In Science &amp; Visualization

* DAGs help us:

    - Identify the variables that are important to the question
    - Identify the variables that are confounding
    - Identify the variables that are missing
    - Identify the variables that are measured incorrectly

* Having a good idea of the causal structure of a question helps us know what to visualize.

## DAGs as a Visualization Tool

* DAGs:

    1. are themselves visualizations
    2. encode scientific problems and causal structures
* We can use the `daggity` R package to visualize the the causal structure of the problems around the motivating research question

# DAGs and Scientific Complexity

## So What?

* I think it's worth stepping back and considering how complex many scientific questions really are
* We do not always observe everythign we want to, but with the help of DAGs we can:
    - Identify the variables that are important to the question
    - Identify what we can actually observe
    - Identify what we cannot observe
    - Assess the limitations we face with causal analysis

## Next Steps

* We are now going to work through seven applications/case studies, each addressing a different aspect of visualization.
* In our first case study, we will examine how to visualize spatial variation.

## Side Quest: Simulated Data

* In `examples/dag_sim_data.qmd` we simulated data that encodes the DAG structure.
* Let's take a very brief glance at that file to see how we simulated the data.

# Applications

## Application 1: Choropleths

* In `applications_1_choropleth.qmd` we create a choropleth map of the United States using the simulated data from above
* We show how even with maps, small multiples help find clarity

## Application 2: Forest Plots

* In `applications_2_forest_plots.qmd` we create a forest plot of the data using the same simulated data.
* We show how spatial variation can often be visualized better without actual maps.

## Application 3: Ridgeline Plots

* In `applications_3_ridge_plots.qmd` we create a ridgeline plot of the data using the same simulated data.
* We show how ridgeline plots can show distributional differences across groups.

## Application 4: Distributions

* In `applications_4_distributions.qmd` we examine distributions of variables
* Wecreate box plots and violin plots to show the distribution of a variable across a population.

## Application 5: Time Trends

* In `applications_5_time_trends.qmd` we examine time trends of variables
* We create line plots to show how a variable changes over time.

## Application 6: Scale Honesty & Effectiveness  

* In `applications_6_scale_honesty.qmd` we examine how axes can be used to mislead or clarify
* We briefly discuss how what counts as dishonest may be contextual

## Application 7: Visualizing Models  

* In `applications_7_visualizing_models.qmd` we visualize model outputs
* We create coefficient plots and model predictions to help interpret the model


# Summary and Takeaways

* Visualization choices should be driven by the **scientific question**
* Experimentation is key; often the "obvious" plot is not the best plot
* Iterate: build in layers; get the basics down; then polish
* Use small multiples, annotations, and thoughtful scales to guide the viewer
